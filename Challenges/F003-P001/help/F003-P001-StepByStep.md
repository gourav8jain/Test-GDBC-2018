    1. Application Name
    2. Application ID
    3. Object ID
    4. Generate Key (step 9)

12. Open a powershell window, login as Team admin G-venuename-Admin

```powershell
Login-AzureRMAccount
```

13. Get the Subscription ID. Run
```powershell
Get-Azurermsubscription
```
If you see more than one subscription, ask the venue proctor which one to use (likely Azure Pass) and  copy the Subscription ID.

14. Run the CreateResourceGroupForSPN.ps1 script (attached to the workitem)
```powershell

.\CreateResourceGroupsforSPN.ps1 -applicationName "GDBC-AutomateSPN-Teamname" -subscriptionid <your subscription id> -resourcegroup "<your resource group name" -location "location"
 ```
You created a resource group and granted rights to the SPN. This SPN you can use later in VSTS.

To get the SPN application ID (later needed), run 
```powershell
Get-AzureRmADApplication -DisplayNameStartWith "name of your application you created in portal"
```

15. Run this script 3 tuimes for all resource groups (Playground, Test, Production)
