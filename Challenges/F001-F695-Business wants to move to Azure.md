# Business wants to move to Azure #

## Description ##
GDBC Inc. is a hipster shop that sells old albums on vinyl. They are the number 1 online store that sells these kinds of records. Their business exists for many years and since  1 year they have an online music shop. Last year a new CTO started within the company and announced some big changes in the upcoming years. GDBC Inc. needs to be more efficient since profit margins are suffering. They need to be competitive against the new start-ups who launch idea after idea. Therefore the time to market needs to drastically increase. Because GDBC Inc. is a traditional enterprise company it takes a long time to deliver changes in their software.

### ###

Last month the CTO announced that GDBC Inc. is going full DevOps. Everything needs to be automated and the target is to release multiple times a day. To facilitate this, the only platform that will be used from now on, is Azure. A cloud platform from Microsoft. The CTO fiercely believes that the move to cloud will improve productivity and agility.
