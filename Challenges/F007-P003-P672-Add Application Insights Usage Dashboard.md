# Add Application Insights Usage Dashboard #

## Description ##

Now that the application insights resource is being deployed and configured as part of the release pipeline we want to see the usage data that is being collected in application insight. To see the usage data we need to either use the existing Usage Analysis views within application insights or create our own Usages dashboard in azure dashboards. 

GDBC Inc. business wants to quickly get an overview of relevant usage data from application insights. 
A great way to bring out only the relevant data and important metrics to business is to create a custom Azure Dashboard that shows just that data and is easy to monitor by the business. 

### Achievement ###
Create a custom azure dashboard that shows users statistics and active sessions / requests / users. Experiment and see what other usages data you can have on dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria ##
* Custom dashboard has been added to Azure Portal that shows active users / requests / sessions currently and other usage data
