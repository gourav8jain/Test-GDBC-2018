# Link test cases to requirements #

### Why ###
If your test suites include requirements, link these to your test results and view the results on your team's dashboard. This enables end-to-end traceability of requirements for agile teams. For example, when teams do not use planned testing (by creating test plans or test case work items), and instead choose to simply write automated tests that run in the CI/CD pipeline, associating test results with requirements provides an easy way to monitor test results and ensure requirements are met.

## Achievement ##
In this step you will visualize the quality of developed features using requirement to test association.

* Associate tests with  requirements
* Add a Requirements quality widget to the dashboard that shows the test quality for relevant requirements

## Acceptance Criteria ##
* Tests have been associated with requirements
* Requirements with associated tests shown on the dashboard using the Requirements quality widget

## Links ##
* [Associate automated test results with requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/test/associate-automated-results-with-requirements)

## To do ##
* Code with functional tests commited to repo
* A release definition with functional tests needs to extist
