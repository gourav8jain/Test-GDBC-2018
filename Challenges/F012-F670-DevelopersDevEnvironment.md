# Developers complain about long time in setting up their Dev Environment #
## Description ##
The GDBC Inc. development team spends a lot of time setting up their local development environments. They need to install the correct tools, such as SQL Server, and also get the application in the correct state in order to start making changes to it and be productive.
### ###
Using Docker containers can make development teams a lot more productive, since they allow them to define everything that an application needs to build and run in a simple text file that can be checked in together with the rest of the source code.
