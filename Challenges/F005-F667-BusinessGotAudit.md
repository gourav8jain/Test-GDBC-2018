# All software development and deployment needs to be compliant to regulations #
## Description ##
The developers of GDBC Inc. gained quite some speed now they use automated pipelines and cloud technology for their software development and deployments. But just when things started to run smoothly, GDBC Inc. got an audit from the regulatory office around all the financial transactions. The audit report showed some evidence that GDBC Inc. is far from compliant and this should be fixed!
### ###
Some compliancy experts are hired to look at the process and they wrote a big document on what should be done and changed within the current process. This advice consisted of placing manual approval gates and reviews, creating test plans before every release and test evidence for all the steps that have been performed. 
### ###
The CTO was not amused. All progress that has been made in the development process was going to be obsolete when these rules were followed. Together with some technical experts from various areas they started looking at alternatives. After thoroughly reading all the documents they came up with 4 simple principles that in their opinion was the core of being compliant.
### ###
* Ensure integrity by having audit trails on code and artifacts
* Ensure the 4-eyes principle on every change to production
### ###
To their surprise this was acknowledged by the regulatory office and as long as GDBC Inc. can provide this evidence they are good.
### ###
The CTO brought everybody together in a room and described some ways to be compliant but still keep their development speed.
