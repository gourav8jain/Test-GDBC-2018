# Step By Step: Run quick smoke tests #

1. Create a feature branch in your repository by running `git checkout -b feature/add-smoke-test`
2. Add a script to your repository called `ping.ps1`, this is also attached to the workitem.
*for the rest of this step-by-step we will assume the path is `scripts\ping.ps1`
3. Add the following contents to the script:
```powershell
param($Url)

$result = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $Url -Method Get

if($result.StatusCode -ne 200) {
    throw "Expected status code 200 but got $($result.StatusCode) from $($Url)"
}else{
    Write-Host "Success: got status code $($result.StatusCode) from $($Url)"
}
```
4. Commit and push the file to VSTS by running:
* `git add *` 
* `git commit -m "added ping script"`
* `git push -u origin feature/add-smoke-test`
