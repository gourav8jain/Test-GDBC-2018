# Business want to control releases of a feature #
## Description ##
At the launch party of a well known artist GDBC Inc. wanted to make a big impression. They made a unique deal with this artist to have the exclusive right to sell the music for at least a month. The idea was that the landing page of the web application showed this news so people would directly be attracted to this exclusive offer. The development team worked day and night to get the web application ready and just before the press conference started they released their web app. Unfortunately, that did not go well. The release failed, and the press conference could only show screenshots.

After a very well organized blameless post-mortem it became clear that this error was caused by the fact that there was no real time to test. GDBC Inc. decided to start looking at ways how the business could be enabled to do their releases themselves. Separating the functional release form the technical deployment. This way, they can decide when something goes live without being dependent on a technical release that can fail.
