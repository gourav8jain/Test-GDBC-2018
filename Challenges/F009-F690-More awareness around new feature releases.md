# More awareness around new feature releases and coolness #
## Description ##
The GDBC Inc. development team are beginning to improve their DevOps processes and they are now releasing more frequently than ever before.  
However they find that internal teams and stakeholders are not aware of when new features are available, reducing the potential feedback and goodwill. 
### ###
Since they already are using Slack internally, GDBC Inc. want to publish a message for each new internal release to one of the Slack channels. Also, for production releases they want to post a message of the new release to Twitter, to communicate with their customers and end users.
### ###
When the HR department hears about the social media plans, they directly join in the conversation. In the ongoing war on talent, they want to make GDBC Inc. more cool Any idea is welcome!
